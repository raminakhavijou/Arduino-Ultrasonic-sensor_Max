This repository includes a Max/MSP patch and an Arduino script. The Max patch receives data from Arduino, reading information from ultrasonic sensors. 
An ultrasonic sensor is a device that uses ultrasonic waves for distance measurement or object detection. It typically consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter emits ultrasonic waves, and these waves bounce off objects in their path. The receiver then detects the reflected waves and calculates the distance or presence of an object based on the time it takes for the waves to return.
Key features and applications of ultrasonic sensors include their non-contact nature, accurate distance measurement capabilities, and versatility in various fields such as robotics, industrial automation, and automotive systems. 
Here are the videos using Ultrasonic sensors and Max/MSP:
